# Inventory Management System (IMS)

## Project Scope

The **Inventory Management System (IMS)** is a robust web-based application tailored for businesses, particularly in the **automotive repair industry**, to manage their inventory operations across multiple branches. Its core functionality includes monitoring stock levels, managing product data, recording sales, and generating reports.

The IMS addresses the common challenges faced by inventory managers and administrators by leveraging a relational database and an intuitive web interface. It streamlines inventory-related workflows, reduces manual effort, and enhances operational efficiency.

With flexible configuration options, the IMS supports customized inventory policies and reporting needs, enabling **data-driven decision-making** and **supply chain optimization**.

IMS ensures streamlined inventory operations with features such as:

* Real-time inventory tracking across multiple branches for accurate and reliable stock records
* Role-based access control to ensure secure and appropriate system access
* Sales logging and inter-location order management to streamline transactions and stock movement
* Client and employee data management for centralized and organized information
* Identity integration via ASP.NET Core Identity for secure authentication and authorization
* Real-time stock visibility across all locations to enhance decision-making
* Automated alerts to prevent overstocking and understocking issues
* Enhanced customer service through optimized stock levels and faster response times

## Architecture

### Application Layers â€“ 3-Tier Architecture

1. **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**  
   * Built with **ASP.NET Core MVC** (Views and Controllers).  
   * Uses **HTML** for structured content, **CSS** for styling, and **Bootstrap** for responsive, mobile-first design.  
   * Implements a clear separation of concerns following the MVC pattern for a maintainable UI.

2. **Business Logic Layer**  
   * Developed using **C#** within the .NET ecosystem.  
   * Handles all core logic, such as inventory checks, sales operations, and role-based access control.  
   * Ensures scalability and clean application behavior through service classes and controller logic.

3. **Data Access Layer**  
   * Utilizes **Entity Framework Core** as the ORM.  
   * Connects to a **SQL Server** database for efficient, type-safe data operations.  
   * Supports complex transactions and queries for reliable inventory and user data management.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to configure and run the IMS locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman2610/Inventory-Management-System.git
cd Inventory-Management-System
```

### 2. Configure the Database

Update `appsettings.json` with your SQL Server connection string:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=IMS_DB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
```

### 3. Apply Migrations and Seed Data

Use the CLI to apply migrations and seed initial data:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

(Optional) You can include a data seeding class in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`.

### 4. Run the Application
